# ev3converter
Converts a Lego EV3 format file to/from series of ascii files for better version control.

This program is designed to expand the LEGO EV3 project file into
small files mostly in ascii format.  Some files still remain in binary
but all of your programs will be converted to ascii.                 
This conversion may be useful if you want to do version control in a 
team environment using GitHub, SVN, or other source code version control
system.  When you are ready you can convert the directory to a EV3 file
that you can open in the EV3 software from LEGO
